# Restaurant Management System
 The Restaurant Management System employs a variety of data structures and algorithms to effectively handle the restaurant's menu and customer reservations. Dynamic menu management is achieved using linked lists, allowing for efficient addition and removal of items. To enhance search, insertion, and deletion operations, Binary Search Trees (BST) are implemented, offering logarithmic time complexity on average. Stacks are utilized to facilitate undo operations, allowing recent changes to be reversed easily. Queues ensure customer reservations and waitlists are managed in a first-come, first-served manner. The system also includes file I/O operations to persistently store and retrieve menu and customer information, maintaining data integrity across sessions. Together, these components form a comprehensive and efficient system for restaurant management.
